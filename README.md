# Executive Summary

While the domestic "Vendor-State" focuses on the capture of US federal agencies (DOGE, HHS, DoD), the global strategy operates on a tripartite logic of Structural Subsumption.
The "Stargate" AI infrastructure and "IL6 Ghost Architecture" are not merely domestic tools; they are being exported as the mandatory operating system for the Western alliance. This creates a transnational "Asymmetric Alliance," where interoperability is achieved not through military protocols, but through shared dependency on a private vendor oligopoly.
The Global Taxonomy

This repository documents three distinct strategies applied by the Vendor-Nexus:

| Region | Strategy | Objective | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Allies (Japan, UK, AUS) | Structural Subsumption | OS Sovereignty Capture | The "IL6 Ghost" Architecture |
| Emerging Asia (India, Indo) | Operational Dominance | Infrastructure Control | Connectivity Dependencies (Starlink) |
| The Gulf (Saudi, UAE) | Capital Extraction | Liquidity for Stargate | "Circular Dependency" (MGX/PIF) |

# Repository Contents

1. The Asymmetric Alliance: Forensic Audit
The core document. A 15,000-word analysis detailed:
 * The Ghost Architectures: How "Ghost Staff" (Kliger, Minor) and "Confidential 450" filings are used to bypass oversight.
 * The Sovereign Exception: Analysis of pardons (Leiweke, Cuellar) and regulatory immunity as tools of statecraft.
 * Country Case Studies: Deep dives into Japan (MHI vs. Anduril), The UK (NHS Data), and Indonesia (Oracle Batam).
2. Scenario 01: The Rogue Node Crisis
A predictive wargame simulating a Taiwan Strait crisis under the Vendor-State model.
 * Hypothesis: The US Vendor-Nexus will utilize "Kill Switch Diplomacy" and "Narrative Warfare" to throttle allied escalation, prioritizing supply chain stability over treaty obligations.
