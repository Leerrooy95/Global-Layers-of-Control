## The Asymmetric Alliance: A Forensic Audit of the Global Vendor-State

Status: Active / Rolling Assessment
Version: 2.1 (International Layer)
Date: December 6, 2025

## What This Is

This repository documents the international expansion of what I initially identified as a domestic US phenomenon: the transformation of the state from technology *customer* to technology *platform* for a specific cohort of vendors (Oracle, Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX, xAI).

**Key Finding:** The same structural patterns documented domestically (procurement bypasses, personnel isomorphism, regulatory capture) reproduce internationally through bilateral treaties, "sovereign cloud" arrangements, and defense modernization programs.

## Why This Matters

Allied nations (Poland, Ukraine, Israel, Japan, India, Indonesia) are integrating US vendor technologies into critical sovereignty functions:
- National defense (Palantir's Maven, Anduril's Barracuda)
- Intelligence infrastructure (Oracle sovereign cloud, Project Nimbus)
- Communications (Starlink monopoly)
- Energy systems (Westinghouse nuclear)

**The Risk:** If software dependencies include vendor override capabilities (precedent: Starlink/Sevastopol geofencing), allied sovereignty becomes conditional on vendor approval.

## Research Progression

This is the fourth repository in a sequence:
1. [AI Manipulation OSINT Case Study](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/AI-Manipulation-OSINT-Case-Study) - Identified systematic AI bias
2. [Layers of Control: From AI to Ellison](link) - Mapped domestic ownership structures
3. [Tech Consolidation Map](link) - Documented domestic bureaucratic capture
4. **Global Layers** (this repo) - Tested if the model exports internationally

**Conclusion:** The pattern holds. The mechanisms that work domestically (OTAs, sole-source contracts, SGE appointments) have international analogs (bilateral bypasses, sovereign cloud fictions, tech substitution).

## Documents in This Repository

### Primary Analyses
- **[Asymmetric Dominion Report]** - The full theoretical framework
- **[European Vector]** - How the Brussels Effect collapsed under US pressure
- **[Ukraine/Israel Kinetic Integration]** - Battlefield as beta test
- **[Investigative Briefing]** - Condensed version for institutional actors

### Regional Deep Dives
- Poland (Barracuda missile lock-in)
- Japan (Sovereign cloud paradox)
- India (Operational dominance via oligarch partnerships)
- Indonesia (Starlink/Oracle infrastructure capture)

## Methodology

**What's Documented:**
- Contract awards and modifications (public procurement databases)
- Personnel flows (appointment announcements, LinkedIn, press releases)
- Regulatory changes (executive orders, legislation, EU Commission documents)
- Temporal correlations (policy shifts coinciding with vendor milestones)

**What's Interpreted:**
- Causal mechanisms (is correlation = causation?)
- Strategic intent (coordination vs. emergent alignment?)
- Theoretical frameworks (Schmitt, Girard, techno-feudalism)

**I explicitly separate these tiers.** Challenge the interpretation, but the underlying documentation stands.

## How to Use This Research

**For Allied Security Analysts:**
Focus on the contract analysis sections. Key questions to ask about your procurement:
- Does the vendor retain kill-switch capability?
- Does "sovereign cloud" actually prevent US intelligence access under CLOUD Act?
- What happens if the vendor dispute arises during a crisis?

**For Oversight Bodies:**
Focus on the "Critical Unknowns" in the Investigative Briefing. These are testable questions requiring institutional resources to answer.

**For Researchers:**
All documents include cited sources. Build on this framework, challenge it, test it against other cases.

**For Journalists:**
The temporal correlations (NSS language → Digital Omnibus capitulation, troop withdrawal → tech sales spike) are the newsworthy hooks. The documents provide the receipts.

## What This Is NOT

- Proof of criminal conspiracy
- Complete evidentiary package (requires institutional investigation to validate)
- Assertion that any individual actor has malicious intent
- Anti-American or anti-technology polemic

**It's a structural risk assessment based on documented patterns.**
